<b>Origins</b>
<p>The game of Euchre has been played in the United States since the early 1800s. There have been some changes made over the years, particularly the addition of the Joker card as the highest 
value trump card, known as the "best bower", in addition to the standard right and left bars. This is still the case in some versions of the game <em><small>(see the <a href="arules.html">Alternate Rules</a> page for details)
</em></small>. Around the 1860s, Jokers were added to the manufacture of standard decks in the U.S., and by the end of the 1880s in Brittain. Jokers have a design unique to their manufacturer, much like the Ace of spades 
(Parlett, 2017).</p>
<p>Eucher appears to be a direct variation of the popular Alslantian game of Juckerspiel, which is a derivative of the 15th century French card game Triomphe. Triomphe is a trick-taking game with a suit selected as trump, 
and is accredited as the linguistic origin of the English word &quot;trump&quot;. Triomphe is also the ancestor of other trick taking games like Whisk (which later evolved into common day Bridge). Triomphe itself seems to 
be a decendant of another 5-trick game called Karn&ouml;ffel, which is mentioned in records dating back as early as 1426.(Parlett, 2017)</p>
<p>Personally, I found it very fascinating that something that was created for the purpose of entertainment <em>over 600 years ago</em> is still used today in a variety forms. Ask anyone what their favorite card game is, 
and you will most likely get an answer. Even if it does not use the traditional 52 card deck with four suits, there are many different playing card games in existence today, and not just in the traditional physical form. 
Digital card games have been around in some form or another for decades, and are as popular (if not more) than physical card games. Aside from dice and chess, how many other games have persevered through the years and still 
holds their own in the digital era?</p></article>
