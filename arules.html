<p>The rules for Euchre found on the main page are those that I have learned through <em>years</em> of playing. I understand that the rules may vary depending on the region, so I compared the rules as I know them to the rules 
posted on other websites. In doing so I found there are other variations to the game, and those are listed below<sup>&#42;</sup>. Enjoy!</p>
<sup style="padding-left: 1em"; "font-size: 25%";>&#42;</sup><small style="font-size: 60%">Only the differences from the standard rules are listed, to preserve space</small><br><br>
<b>Brittish Euchre</b>
 <ul>
  <li>Addition of one Joker card to the standard deck called the &quot;Benny&quot; or &quot;Best Bower&quot;. This has the highest value of any trump card, followed by the standard values: Right bower, Left bower, 
   Ace, King, Queen, 10, 9. If the deck lacks a Joker, the 2 of Spades (2<object> &spades;</object>) can be substituted.</li>
  <li>The dealer's partner cannot order the up card as trump unless they play alone.</li>
  <li>If the Benny (Joker) is turned up, the dealer must declare a trump suit without looking at their hand, then pick up the Benny and discard one from their hand.</li>
  <li>Any player, after trump has been selected and before the first play, can declare they are playing alone, regardless of whether or not they declared trump. It is also possible that one player from each team 
   decides to play alone in the same hand, so there are only 2 playing.</li>
  <li>If 2 players are going alone, the player that did not declare trump leads.</li>
  <li>If a member of the team that declared trump goes alone and gets Euchered, the other team scores 4 points instead of 2.</li>
  <li>The game is over when one team reaches 11 points, 15 points, or 10, depending on the agreed total.</li>
  <li>A rule that is accepted by some is if a player passes trump in the first round they cannot go alone.</li> 
 </ul>
<b>Six Player Euchre</b>
 <ul>
  <li>There are 2 teams made up of 3 players.</li>
  <li>The 8s and 7s are added to the deck (totalling 33 cards) <em>or</em> 2 decks of 25 (standard plus a Joker) are used (totalling 50 cards).</li>
  <li>If a double pack is used and 2 cards of the same value are played in a trick, the card that was played second wins the trick. If both Bennys are played and one of them has color (versus black and white), 
   the one with color wins. If they are the same, the one played second wins the trick.
  <li>3 points are awarded for Euchering the team that made trump, or for winning all 5 tricks in a hand (instead of 2 for either).</li>
  <li>If a player decides to go alone, the other members lay down their cards. The loner can ask one of their partners for their best card, but not both.</li>
  <li>If the loner wins all 5 tricks, they earn 6 points instead of 4. If only 3 or 4 tricks are won, they earn 3 points.</li>
 </ul>
<b>North American Euchre (Variations)</b>
 <ul>
  <li>8s can be added to the deck (totaling 28 cards) as well as 7s (totaling 32 cards).
  <li>In Canada, Australia, and England, if the dealer's partner orders up the trump card, they must play alone.</li>
  <li>In Canada, the cards must be cut by the player on the dealer's right and cards are dealt one at a time.</li>
  <li><strong>&quot;Stick the Dealer&quot;:</strong> In this variation, if the selection of trump is passed over a second time by all players, the dealer must make trump.</li>
  <li><strong>&quot;Railroading&quot;:</strong> This is a variant of the &quot;Partner's Best&quot; rule. When a player goes alone, their partner may pass them a card face down. The loner must decide if they 
   want to accept their partner's card <em>before</em> looking at it.</li>
 </ul>
<b>Buck Euchre (a.k.a. Cut-Throat)</b>
 <ul>
  <li>There are no partners, everyone plays as individuals, and there is a penalty for not winning any tricks in a hand.</li>
  <li>The player that orders trump must win 3 tricks or suffer a penalty. The other players are given the chance to "drop-out", thus avoiding penalties for not winning a trick. Players cannot drop-out more than 
   2 consecutive turns. If they do not play on the third hand, they must add 5 points to their total.</li>
  <li>If the turned up card is Clubs <object>&clubs;</object>, that automatically becomes the trump suit and everyone must play and win at least 1 trick to avoid penalty.</li>
  <li>If no one orders trump in either the first or second round, the game is played without trump and all players must win at least 1 trick to avoid penalty.</li>
  <li>Everyone starts with 25 points, and the first player to 0 wins the game. Players get to subtract 1 point for each trick they win. If the highest bidder fails to win 3 tricks they add 5 points to their total, otherwise 
   they subtract 1 point per trick won. Players that fail to win any tricks add 5 points to their total. If two players reach 0 in the same hand, it is a tie. If the players' scores drop below 0, the player with the lower 
   score wins.</li>
  <li>If a player wins all 5 tricks in a hand at any point of the game, the win the entire game.</li>
 </ul>
<b>Dirty Clubs</b><i><small>(Same rules as Buck Euchre, with the following exceptions)</small></i>: 
 <ul>
  <li>Players start with 20 points</li>
  <li>If the turned up card is not a club <object>&clubs;</object>, each player bids on how many tricks they could get if they named trump, starting on the dealer's left. The minimum is 1 and the next player must either bid 
      higher or pass. The highest bidder can then either name a trump suit (clubs included) or declare there will be no trump suit. If they name a trump suit, they may take the turned up card (even if it is not trump) and 
	  discard one from their hand.</li>
  <li>Once trump is made, starting from the left of the player that named trump, each player has a chance to "drop-out".</li>
  <li>More than 4 players can be added by adding extra low cards (8, 7, etc.) as needed.</li>
 </ul>
<b>Three Player Buck Euchre</b>
 <ul>
  <li>Each player starts with 15 points.</li>
  <li>4 hands are still dealt, but no card is turned up. The fourth hand is called the widow. Each player, after looking at their hand, has the opportunity to trade their hand for the widow. The player to the right 
      of the dealer has the first option, then the dealer, then the remaining player.</li>
  <li>Bidding takes place just like in Dirty Clubs, except you can bid more than 5 tricks.</li>
  <li>1 point is deducted for each trick won. 5 points are added for not winning any tricks or for failing to win 3 for the trump maker. Winning all 5 tricks allows you to deduct 5 points from your total, not win the whole 
      game.</li>
  <li>A player with 5 or fewer points cannot drop out of a hand.</li>
 </ul>
<b>Six Hand Almonte Euchre</b><i><small>(Same rules as Six Player Euchre, with the following exceptions)</small></i>:
 <ul>
  <li>A standard deck plus the 8s and 3 jokers, represented by the 4, 3, and 2 of Spades, in order of value (4 <object>&spades;</object>, 3<object>&spades;</object>, 2<object>&spades;</object>, Right Bower, Left Bower, etc.).
  </li>
  <li>There is only one left over card, so all are in play except the last one turned up. If the last one turned up is a joker, then the dealer calls trump before looking at their hand.</li>
  <li>The game is played to 15 points.</li>
 </ul>
